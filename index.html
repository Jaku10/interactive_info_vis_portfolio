          <p class="small-note"></p>
          <p>
            Context: This sketch visualizes time as a calming, continuous flow for users who want a softer, more ambient sense of passing minutes.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> Designed for people seeking a meditative or reflective moment — such as during study breaks, mindfulness sessions, or quiet routines.</li>
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> Spiral particle system: I created a radial pattern with six arms that spiral outward, creating a meditative flow that expands as time progresses, visually representing the accumulation of moments.

              Soft colors + transparency: The muted sand-colored palette and semi‑transparent particle trails create a calm, non‑distracting visual that fits mindfulness contexts.
              
              Timer controls: Preset duration buttons (1, 5, 10, 20 minutes) and start/pause/reset controls provide practical functionality while maintaining the zen aesthetic.</li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> Add adjustable "sand speed" to let users choose a tempo that matches their mood.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>
            The Zen Sand Clock represents my exploration of time as a meditative, flowing experience rather than a loud and rigid measurement. Creating a system that simulates falling sand to show visual aesthetics to users, creating a sense of calm and tranquility. The challenge was making the sand feel organic and calming while maintaining clear visual feedback about time passage. I learned that subtle color shifts and gradual motion can create a sense of tranquility that traditional clocks often lack. The timer functionality adds practical value, but the real success of this design lies in its ability to transform time from something stressful into something contemplative. </p>

        <p class="small-note"></p>
        <p>
          Context: This sketch visualizes pacing and countdown timing for runners who want a simple, intuitive way to track interval durations.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Context:</strong> Designed for athletes, joggers, or anyone training with timed intervals — useful on a laptop, tablet, or projected during workouts.</li>
          <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> Oval track layout: I chose a classic running‑track shape because runners naturally think in laps and pacing, making the metaphor instantly familiar.

            Countdown slider: The slider lets users set their interval duration quickly, supporting flexible training routines.
            
            Moving runner dot: The animated dot provides a visual sense of progress and pacing, making time feel active rather than abstract.</li>
          <li><strong>Future work:</strong> Add selectable pacing modes (slow, moderate, fast) to simulate different training intensities.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>The Track Running Timer challenged me to think about time in the context of physical activity and goal-oriented tasks. The oval track metaphor emerged from my understanding that athletes and fitness enthusiasts naturally think in terms of laps, pacing, and completion. Creating the smooth animation of the runner dot around the track required careful calculation of elliptical paths and progress mapping. The slider interface for setting duration needed to be intuitive enough for quick adjustments during workouts. This project reinforced my understanding that effective time visualization can leverage athletes, the running track, to make time feel more tangible and motivating. The visual progress around the track provides immediate feedback that helps users maintain focus and pace, challenging runners of any type to set goals and complete times.</p>

        <p class="small-note"></p>
        <p>
          Context: This sketch visualizes the relationship between sunlight and time, helping users understand how shadows encode the hour.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Context:</strong> Designed for learners, outdoor enthusiasts, or anyone curious about natural timekeeping — useful in educational settings or as an ambient desktop visual.</li>
          <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> Shadow‑based time: I used a rotating shadow instead of hands to highlight the physical principles behind sundials.

            Draggable sun interaction: Allowing users to move the sun helps them explore how light direction affects shadow length and angle.
            
            Roman numeral ring: The numerals reinforce the historical feel and make the clock readable without breaking the natural aesthetic.</li>
          <li><strong>Future work:</strong> Add seasonal tilt or latitude adjustments to simulate real‑world sundial behavior.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>The Interactive Sundial Clock represents my most successful exploration of time visualization through natural and a physical clock. What makes this design special is its educational value, most users don't just read the time, they understand the physical relationship between light, shadow, and time. The draggable sun interaction changes what a normal clock represents, allowing users to experiment with how solar position affects timekeeping. The dynamic sky color connects time to the natural rhythms of day and night. The Roman numerals provide historical context while maintaining readability. This project taught me that the best time visualizations don't just display information, they reveal the underlying principles that represent how we measure time. The combination of interactivity, natural aesthetics, and educational value makes this clock both beautiful and meaningful.</p>
        <h4>Why I chose this final clock</h4>
        <p>I chose the Interactive Sundial Clock as my final design because it uniquely combines multiple design principles that I value most: interactivity, educational value, natural aesthetics, and meaningful metaphor. Unlike purely digital or abstract representations, the sundial connects time to tangible physical phenomena, such as sunlight and shadows, which creates a deeper understanding of time's relationship to our natural world. The draggable sun interaction transforms users from passive observers into active explorers, making the learning experience engaging and memorable. This clock doesn't just tell time, it teaches users about the fundamental principles of solar timekeeping while remaining visually beautiful and functionally clear. The combination of these elements makes it not just a clock, but an educational tool and a work of interactive art.
